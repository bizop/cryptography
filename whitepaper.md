## Introduction

With the rapid advancement of quantum computing, traditional encryption methods based on factorization and discrete logarithm problems are becoming increasingly vulnerable to quantum attacks. To address this concern, researchers have been exploring quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes that can withstand the computational power of quantum computers. One promising approach is the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem, which has been widely studied and is believed to be secure against quantum attacks [1].

In this white paper, we present a quantum-resistant encryption scheme based on the LWE problem. The scheme utilizes a public-key cryptosystem, where the public key is used for encryption and the private key is used for decryption. The security of the scheme relies on the hardness of solving the LWE problem, which is a well-established computational problem in lattice-based cryptography [2].

## Mathematical Concepts

The following mathematical concepts are used in the implementation of the encryption scheme:

- $\mathbb{Z}_q$: The set of integers modulo $q$, where $q$ is a prime number.
- $\mathbf{A}$: A randomly generated matrix of size $n \times n$ with elements in $\mathbb{Z}_q$.
- $\mathbf{s}$: A randomly generated vector of size $n \times 1$ with elements in $\mathbb{Z}_q$, representing the private key.
- $\mathbf{e}$: An error vector of size $n \times 1$ with elements drawn from a discrete Gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sigma$.
- $\mathbf{b}$: The public key vector of size $n \times 1$, computed as $\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{s} + \mathbf{e} \mod q$.
- $\mathbf{m}$: The binary message vector of size $n \times 1$, obtained by converting the plaintext message to binary.
- $\mathbf{r}$: A randomly generated vector of size $n \times 1$ with binary elements, used for encryption.
- $\mathbf{u}$: The first component of the ciphertext, computed as $\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{r} \mod q$.
- $\mathbf{v}$: The second component of the ciphertext, computed as $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{b}^T\mathbf{r} + \lfloor\frac{q}{2}\rfloor\mathbf{m} \mod q$.

## Encryption Process

The encryption process consists of the following steps:

1. Convert the plaintext message to binary and pad it to a length that is a multiple of $n$.
2. Divide the padded binary message into chunks of size $n$.
3. For each chunk $\mathbf{m}$, generate a random binary vector $\mathbf{r}$ of size $n \times 1$.
4. Compute the ciphertext components $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ as follows:
   - $\mathbf{u} = \mathbf{A}^T\mathbf{r} \mod q$
   - $\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{b}^T\mathbf{r} + \lfloor\frac{q}{2}\rfloor\mathbf{m} \mod q$
5. Repeat steps 3-4 for each chunk of the message.
6. Return the encrypted message as a list of ciphertext pairs $(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v})$.

## Decryption Process

The decryption process consists of the following steps:

1. For each ciphertext pair $(\mathbf{u}, \mathbf{v})$, compute the decryption attempt as follows:
   - $\mathbf{d} = \mathbf{v} - \mathbf{u}^T\mathbf{s} \mod q$
2. Round each element of $\mathbf{d}$ to the nearest multiple of $\lfloor\frac{q}{2}\rfloor$ and divide by $\lfloor\frac{q}{2}\rfloor$ to obtain the binary message chunk.
3. Concatenate the decrypted binary chunks and remove any padding to obtain the original binary message.
4. Convert the binary message back to the plaintext message.

## Security Analysis

The security of the proposed encryption scheme relies on the hardness of the LWE problem. The LWE problem states that, given a matrix $\mathbf{A}$ and a vector $\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{A}\mathbf{s} + \mathbf{e}$, where $\mathbf{s}$ is a secret vector and $\mathbf{e}$ is an error vector drawn from a discrete Gaussian distribution, it is computationally infeasible to determine $\mathbf{s}$ [3].

The best-known algorithms for solving the LWE problem have a complexity that is exponential in the dimension $n$ [4]. Therefore, by choosing appropriate values for $n$ and $q$, the scheme can achieve a high level of security against both classical and quantum attacks.

## Conclusion

In this white paper, we presented a quantum-resistant encryption scheme based on the Learning with Errors (LWE) problem. The scheme utilizes a public-key cryptosystem and provides a secure means of encrypting and decrypting messages in the presence of quantum adversaries. The mathematical notations and concepts used in the implementation were explained in detail, along with the encryption and decryption processes.

The proposed scheme demonstrates the feasibility of achieving quantum-resistant encryption using the LWE problem and serves as a foundation for further research and development in the field of post-quantum cryptography. As quantum computing advances, it is crucial to develop and adopt quantum-resistant encryption schemes to ensure the security of sensitive information in the future.
